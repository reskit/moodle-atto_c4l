# Components For Learning (c4l)
 
A plugin for the Moodle Atto editor providing a set of visual components designed explicitly for Learning, based on the parent project components-for-learning.org (soon available).

No configuration settings are required for this plugin. Just install it from the Site Administration area (Plugins → Install plugins → Install plugin from ZIP file). 

Once the plugin is installed, you will need to make the button visible in the Atto editor. To do so, also in the Site Administration area, go to Plugins → Text Editors → Atto HTML editor. Then scroll down to the Toolbar config area, and add the text 'c4l' wherever you wish the editor bar to show the button. For instance, if you want the button to show before the 'emojipicker' button, just insert it like that:

`files = c4l, emojipicker, image, media, recordrtc, managefiles, h5p`

The plugin is part of a broader, collaborative project called Components for Learning (components-for-learning.org, soon available). You will find there all the related documentation and detailed usage recommendations and examples for all components included here.

This plugin is strongly inspired by the Poodle Snippet plugin (https://moodle.org/plugins/atto_snippet) by Justin Hunt. Certain functions and structural elements are directly taken from the aforementioned plugin.
